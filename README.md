Demand Forecasting for Food Delivery Data

Food delivery and restaurants benefit from forecasting food demand since it increases profits by reducing uncertainty in labor and food waste which are the two largest costs for restaurants. The data for this project was obtained from this ​competition​. This project tries to forecast weekly food deliveries for one company using historical data. We found the best model to forecast demand is a dynamic regression model which beat the baseline average model by over 40%. If implemented this model would drastically reduce labor and food costs for our company by creating more certainly in demand meaning our food delivery client could hire fewer drivers and reduce food waste.
